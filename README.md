Simple Search Engine
This simple search engine project indexes a set of documents, allowing users to search for specific terms and retrieve the documents containing those terms along with the number of hits.

Features
Index Creation: The application builds an index of documents using a unique ID (file name) and a list of tokens (words) contained within each document.
Search Functionality: Users can input search terms through the console, and the application returns the file names where those terms were found along with the number of hits.
